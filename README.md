This project is a PDF data extraction tool designed to process voter list PDFs and extract key information like serial numbers, voter IDs, names, and more using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). It converts PDF pages to images, preprocesses them for better clarity, detects specific data regions, and extracts text while saving cropped sections for reference. The tool outputs the extracted data into an Excel file for easy analysis and allows users to handle multiple PDFs efficiently. It also includes robust error handling and logging for seamless processing and support multi language extractions.
